linpackc
========

The Linpack benchmark code measures floating point performance. It was developed as part 
of the Linpack matrix computation library. For more information, see the 
[Linpack Benchmark FAQ](http://www.netlib.org/utk/people/JackDongarra/faq-linpack.html).

This code has been modified only to compile and run on the 
[Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) and Mac OS X.
